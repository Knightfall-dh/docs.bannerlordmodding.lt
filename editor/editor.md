# Editor

## Problems/Solutions

### Does not start

- Version mismatch with the base game - does not start at all, no process - install same version
- Hanged previous process - check Task Manager, kill old process

### Crashes

- When deleting used texture. After crash/restart Texture appears deleted

#### Map crashes

- Not fully saved map - could be the reason that game was active/loaded/in progress when map was saved. Go to the Main Menu, then save the map in the Editor.

### Hangs on save

- Too much terrain editing (Smoothing?). Export heightmap before trying to save after a lot of Smoothing.
