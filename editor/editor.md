# Editor

## Problems/Solutions

### Does not start

- Version mismatch with the base game - does not start at all, no process - install same version
- Hanged previous process - check Task Manager, kill old process

### Hangs on save

- Too much terrain editing (Smoothing?). Export heightmap before trying to save after a lot of Smoothing.

To cancel the Save, use X from the Taskbar:
